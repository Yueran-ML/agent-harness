"""Small faults to put into the code, to see whether the tests notice.

A mutant is a replacement of text in one source file. ``mutate.py`` puts each
one in, runs the tests that ought to notice, and takes it out again. A mutant
that the tests do not notice points at something they do not check.

The text to replace must occur exactly once in its file. ``test_mutants.py``
checks that for every mutant, so a list cannot go stale without a test failing.

Left out on purpose are mutants that change nothing that can be observed. One
example: counting the lines after the wanted ones on the slow path of the
reader instead of the fast one.
